# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Later it can be turned to a PWA through a serviceWorker
## Issue

1) Don't feed with bad json (no protection yet)
2) IDs are weird, nanoid is an option, but so far it works anyway
3) Downloading new file instead of writing to the uploaded one (access to fileSystem)


## Todo
1) Finish Farenheit convertion
2) Reduce inline css
3) Add serviceWorker
4) Put data into gun.js
